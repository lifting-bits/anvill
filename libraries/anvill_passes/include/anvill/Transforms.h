// Anvill's approach to stack frame recovery is slightly atypical: if a
// function's return address is stored on the stack, or if a function's
// arguments are stored on the stack (typical in x86), then these are all
// considered to be part of the stack frame. In that way, the stack frame
// actually extends into what is typically thought of as the caller's stack
// frame. This approach is very convenient, but comes at the cost of having

// eliminate the calls to these functions on its own because they are not
// "pure" functions.

// NOTE(pag): This pass must be applied before any kind of renaming of lifted

// we get from Remill uses memory access intrinsics, which abstract over the
// target program's address space and model memory loads/stores in terms of
// intrinsic function calls operating on integer addresses. When these intrinsic
// calls are lowered into `load` and `store` instructions by
// `LowerRemillMemoryAccessIntrinsics`, we are left with a mixed bag in integer
// arithmetic and then `inttoptr` casts.
//
// Ideally, we want to comprehensively brighten all integer operations that
// produce pointers into pointer operations. For example, integer arithmetic
// should instead become `getelementptr` instructions, where possible, which
// model pointer arithmetic at a higher level.

//
// When we lift bitcode, we represent the control-flow transfer semantics of
// function returns with calls to `__remill_function_return`. This is another
// three-argument Remill function, where the second argument is the program
// counter. We're particularly interested in observing this program counter
// value, as it can tell us if this function respects normal return conventions
// (i.e. returns to its return address) or not. The way we try to observe this
// is by inspecting the program counter argument, and seeing if it is
// `__anvill_ra` or the (casted) value returned from the `llvm.returnaddress`
// intrinsic.
//
// When we match the expected pattern, we can eliminate calls to
// `__remill_function_return`. If we don't match the pattern, then it suggests
// that it is possible that the function alters its return address, or that
// something is preventing our analysis from deducing that the return address
// reaches the `__remill_function_return` call's program counter argument.
//
// On x86(-64) and AArch64, we can use the `llvm.addressofreturnaddress` to
// update the return address in place when we fail to match the pattern,
// thereby letting us eliminate the call to `__remill_function_return`.
