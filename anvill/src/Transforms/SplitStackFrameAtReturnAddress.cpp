// Analyze `func` and determine if the function stores the return value of
// the `llvm.returnaddress` intrinsic into an `alloca` (presumed to be the
// stack frame). If so, split the stack frame into three separate `alloca`s:
//
//    1) One for every up to but not including the location where the return
//       address is stored.
//    2) One for the return address itself.
//    3) One for everything else.
//
// The `arch` is consulted to determine the default stack growth direction,
// which informs the behaviour of the function in the presence of multiple
// stores of the return address into a stack frame.
//
// Anvill's approach to stack frame recovery is slightly atypical: if a
// function's return address is stored on the stack, or if a function's
// arguments are stored on the stack (typical in x86), then these are all
// considered to be part of the stack frame. In that way, the stack frame
// actually extends into what is typically thought of as the caller's stack
// frame. This approach is very convenient, but comes at the cost of having
// to do this particular transformation in order to recover more typical stack
// frame structures.
