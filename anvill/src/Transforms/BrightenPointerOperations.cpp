// Anvill-lifted bitcode operates at a very low level, swapping between integer
// and pointer representations. It is typically for just-lifted bitcode to
// perform integer arithmetic on addresses, then cast those integers into
// pointers in order to do a `load` or `store`. This happens because the bitcode
// we get from Remill uses memory access intrinsics, which abstract over the
// target program's address space and model memory loads/stores in terms of
// intrinsic function calls operating on integer addresses. When these intrinsic
// calls are lowered into `load` and `store` instructions by
// `LowerRemillMemoryAccessIntrinsics`, we are left with a mixed bag in integer
// arithmetic and then `inttoptr` casts.
//
// Ideally, we want to comprehensively brighten all integer operations that
// produce pointers into pointer operations. For example, integer arithmetic
// should instead become `getelementptr` instructions, where possible, which
// model pointer arithmetic at a higher level.
//
// This function attempts to apply a battery of pattern-based transforms to
// brighten integer operations into pointer operations.
