//// we get from Remill uses memory access intrinsics, which abstract over the
//// target program's address space and model memory loads/stores in terms of
//// intrinsic function calls operating on integer addresses. When these intrinsic
//// calls are lowered into `load` and `store` instructions by
//// `LowerRemillMemoryAccessIntrinsics`, we are left with a mixed bag in integer
//// arithmetic and then `inttoptr` casts.
////
//// Ideally, we want to comprehensively brighten all integer operations that

//// should instead become `getelementptr` instructions, where possible, which

//
// When we lift bitcode, we represent the control-flow transfer semantics of
// function returns with calls to `__remill_function_return`. This is another
// three-argument Remill function, where the second argument is the program
// counter. We're particularly interested in observing this program counter
// value, as it can tell us if this function respects normal return conventions
// (i.e. returns to its return address) or not. The way we try to observe this
// is by inspecting the program counter argument, and seeing if it is
// `__anvill_ra` or the (casted) value returned from the `llvm.returnaddress`
// intrinsic.
//
// When we match the expected pattern, we can eliminate calls to
// `__remill_function_return`. If we don't match the pattern, then it suggests
// that it is possible that the function alters its return address, or that
// something is preventing our analysis from deducing that the return address
// reaches the `__remill_function_return` call's program counter argument.
//
// On x86(-64) and AArch64, we can use the `llvm.addressofreturnaddress` to
// update the return address in place when we fail to match the pattern,
// thereby letting us eliminate the call to `__remill_function_return`.

// `StackFrameStructureInitializationProcedure` in `options`), to enable
// baseline scalar replacement of aggregates (SROA), and if that pass fails

//
// Remill models these situations using opaque function calls, i.e. an
// undefined value is produced via a call to something like
