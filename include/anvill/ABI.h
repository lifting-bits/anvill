// value that is taken as an argument to Remill-lifted functions, passed
// around between memory access intrinsics, and then returned from Remill-
// lifted functions. The Remill memory intrinsics are all marked as pure
// functions, essentially permitting LLVM's optimizer to treat them as
// uninterpreted functions. This has the benefit of LLVM optimizations being
// able to optimize "around" and "across" the intrinsic calls, but it also
// means that if we don't have a final use of the memory pointer that LLVM
// is not allowed to optimize then LLVM's optimizations may decide to eliminate
// uses of memory access intrinsics whose (memory pointer) return vales
// appear to be unused.
